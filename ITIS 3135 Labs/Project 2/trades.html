            Buying low in trades refers to buying players have low value because
            they have been playing poorly. The reason why you would try to trade
            for these players is because you have reason to think that they will
            eventually get better and therefore you get a good player at great
            value.

          <p class="inside-acc">
            Selling high is the opposite of buying low. Selling high is deciding
            which players on your team are at the best value they will be. You
            could trade them after a good game to get more value than what they
            will be for the rest of the year.

              There are few different sections you should be aware of during the
              season. The beginning weeks 1-5 is the first section and usually
              can help your team the most if you play it right. Nobody has any
              trend or idea of who is good in the start, so you can use this
              time to trade for people who have one bad week or trade away
              someone who has a good week if you think it won't continue.
            </p>
            <p class="parts-season-2">
              The middle of the season is probably week 6 until the playoffs in
              week 14. This part involves needing your bench to be deep because
              injuries and bye weeks will make your team thin. If your team is
              deep then you will be able to pick up wins. The playoffs are the
              most important part because you need to make sure your players are
              healthy. You need to win 3 weeks in a row usually so you should
              build your team to peak at the end of the year and be consistent.

        <div class="types-trades-combo">

          <div class="inside-acc">
            <p class="types-trades">
              There are a few types of trades, and usually its either one of the
              following two. The first kind of trade would be an even trade in
              terms of the number of players meaning the players all equal to
              each other somehow. The other is trading multiple players for just
              one person.
            </p>
            <p class="types-trades-2">
              This is the kind of trade I reccommend more. While it may seem
              like you are losing players, it is actually way better to have
              quality over quantity. Also, it gives you more room on your bench
              to add players.
