        <p class="waiver-priority">
          Generally, after each week the league is ranked by best teams to worst
          team. This is first organized by record, and if two teams have the
          same record then it is determined by which team has more overall
          points. So the waiver priority goes in reversed order, worst teams
          have highest waiver priority and can have first choice of available
          players. All waivers are processed by wednesday.

      <div class="pickups-combo">
        <h2 class="pickups-title">Pickups</h2>
        <p class="pickups">
          Now that you know what the waiver wire is and how priority works, it's
          good to know what good pickups are and what pickups are fools gold.
          Most people will see a player have a good week and want to pick them
          up. This is wrong, you should not mainly be looking for points. The
          main thing to look at is consistency and evidence to show its
          repeatable.
        </p>
        <p class="pickups-2">
          Some good metrics to look at are targets, role on the team, and if
          they are young. For example, if a player has 8 receptions for 50 yards
          it shows that his points were not luck and he has a big role on the
          team. If a player has 1 catch for 5 yards and a touchdown, its bad
          because without the touchdown the player would have done bad, so the
          points are most likely unrepeatable.

      <div class="bench-combo">
        <h2 class="bench-title">Bench</h2>
        <p class="bench">
          The bench are the players that you have on your team but dont start.
          The best strategy for your bench is to keep a few players that are
          reliable but have little upside to be safe and make sure you have
          players to get points. However, most of the bench should be dedicated
          to young players or rookies at WR or RB. This is because young players
          are unpredictable but have incredible ceilings meaning you could get
          great value for them.
        </p>
        <p class="bench-2">
          These players have much higher upside than older players usually. The
          reason to mostly include RB and WR is becuase it is more important to
          be deep here becuase they make up the majority of your team. A big
          misconception is that you must have a backup for each position, but
          this is not true you can usually pickup these positions when you need
          them. Below are some different examples of a bench.
